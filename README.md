# Forms

## API call for rudigo portfolio


###UPDATE
I've made the login and register work and arranged the folder structure... dunno if styling it is a must or I should just leave it at it is..

I'm such a terrible person for thinking about NOT styling it

..... anyway.... still need to add some javascript form stuff to make sure users don't put less than required number of characters for password and stuff like that.
should also be able to send messages to the user that email has already been used and stuff like that..
